# LP1 - Indian Startup Ecosystem
*In this project , an in-depth analysis is made into a dataset collected online on the Indian startup ecosystem from 2018 - 2021 using python. Findings were subsequently deployed to  BI for stakeholder visualization and intepretation purposes*

## Project Description
The project proceeded in four main stages consistent with the CRISP-DM approach. However, for the purpose of the required outcome, the modelling and evaluation stages were skipped. The stages include:
*	Business Data Understanding
During this stage, domain knowledge on startups, investment stages and the various relevant sectors on the project was sought through research on the internet and group discussions. This stage aided the understanding of the project requirements and deliverables.

* Data Understanding
Here, efforts were put into understanding the columns of the dataset and how they related to the requirement of the project. This stage was facilitated by extensive research on the domain knowledge. At this point, the decision on columns we might not need and how merging of our dataset was going to be done was taken.

*	Exploratory Data Analysis
About 80% of the work was done in this stage. Python was the tool employed throughout this stage.

  i)Data Overview: The final data was overviewed to obtain the summary statistic using .info() and .describe() methods<br>
 ii) Hypothesis and Analysis Questions: Here, hypothesis was formulated and relevant questions which could bring the insights to satisfy the project requirements were asked.<br>
iii) Data Cleaning: The data had several issues with respect to missing data, duplicated records, inappropriate data types and invalid data entries. A thorough inspection of all the columns was done to prepare the data for analysis. Cleaned data was moved for further analysis.<br>
iv)	Data Analysis: Here all the relevant questions were answered and represented using appropriate charts.


## App Execution
The final visualization charts are deployed to Power BI.
